# ðŸ§  Sidekick â€” Your Personal AI Co-Worker

**Sidekick** is an interactive AI assistant that can perform complex tasks using tools, evaluate its own performance, and ask for clarification when needed. Built with [LangGraph](https://docs.langchain.com/langgraph/), [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/), and a [Gradio UI](https://www.gradio.app/), Sidekick brings reasoning, tool use, and feedback-based iteration into one cohesive workflow.

â”œâ”€â”€ app.py              # Gradio UI for user interaction

â”œâ”€â”€ sidekick_tools.py   # Tool definitions (search, file ops, wiki, Python REPL, push)

# Features
- Iterative assistant that refines its output using feedback
- Auto-evaluates responses based on success criteria
- Uses GPT-4o-mini via LangChain's ChatOpenAI

# Built-in tools:

 - Google Search (Serper API)
 - Wikipedia lookup
 - Python REPL for logic/math
 - File management (read/write/list/delete)
 - Push notifications (via Pushover)

# How It Works
1. You ask a question or give a task.
2. Sidekick uses tools if needed and gives an answer.
3. An evaluator LLM assesses the output based on success criteria.
4. If the answer is not good enough, it tries again or asks you for clarification.
5. Everything runs in a stateful LangGraph.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/sidekick.git](https://github.com/sahidul-shaikh/generative_ai.git)
cd generative_ai/sidekick

2. **Create a .env file**
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
PUSHOVER_TOKEN=your_pushover_app_token
PUSHOVER_USER=your_pushover_user_key

3. **Install dependencies**
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you donâ€™t have a requirements.txt yet, create one using:
pip freeze > requirements.txt

## Run the App
python app.py
This will launch a local Gradio app in your browser.

# Example Use Cases
- "Summarize this Wikipedia article."
- "Find the top 3 news headlines about climate change."
- "What is 2 to the power 12?"
- "Read this file and send me a push notification if it contains the word 'error'."
